	Hello! I'm Dillon, if you couldn't figure that out by the big name in 
	the top left corner. I'm a 21 year old computer science student at
	Mizzou. This website started as a final project for my World Wide Web
	class, so if you see some weird design choices, it's probably a holdover
	from that (you occasionally have to do odd things to satisfy all the
	requirements of a project specification.)

	In addition to computers, I enjoy computers and more computers.

	Also music and films and books and normal stuff.
